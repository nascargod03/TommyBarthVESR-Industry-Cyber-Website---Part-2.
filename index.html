                    <h2>Hard Work</h2>
                    <p>Hard work is important to me because without working hard it is very difficult to achieve your goals.   </p>
                    <p> Hard work was taught to me by my Dad through sports, school, and work, he consistently reminds me that working hard can get you to where you want to be.</p>
                    <p>Hard work is a good value to have because without it, mediocrity and laziness can quickly set in. Laziness and mediocrity cause professional and mental issues in all aspects of life. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Perseverance</h2>
                    <p>Perseverance is very important because if you cannot face adversity and rebound during hard times, the chances of success are very slim. </p>
                    <p>I developed perseverance through football. In high school, my football team was very bad, only winning 1 game between my junior and senior year. </p>
                    <p>Toughing out practices and games taught me to never quit no matter how bad the score was, or how I physically felt. </p>
                    <p>I believe that without perseverance, quitting quickly becomes a habit for the worst. Without seeing things through to the end, we cannot recognize and understand our full potential. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Accountability</h2>
                    <p>Accountability is important to me because if you can't be held accountable for your actions, what is the purpose of doing anything? </p>
                    <p>Growing up I was forced to be accountable for my actions and time management.</p>
                    <p>As someone who was homeschooled through 8th grade, I had to ensure my assignments were done on time, manage my time efficiently, and complete tasks to be able to enjoy extracurriculars. </p>
                    <p>All of these actions taught me Accountability. Applied to the professional world, one who is not accountable is easily left behind and cannot be trusted by their peers.  </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                     <h2>Respect</h2>
                     <p>Respect is important to me because it creates trust and positive relationships with others.</p>
                     <p>This value comes from how I was raised—my family emphasized treating people fairly no matter who they were.</p>
                     <p>Respect matters because it makes teamwork and communication possible. Without it, conflict and distrust quickly take over.</p>
                     <p>If respect is ignored, relationships fall apart, and opportunities to work with others are lost.</p>
